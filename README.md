# Aptitude-Test-Application
Developed a Java-based aptitude test application that prompts users for their name and topic selection before starting. Used a timer for every question to improve time management and test rapid problem-solving abilities. Created a dynamic scoreboard that shows the user's score, name, and rank at the completion of the test.
